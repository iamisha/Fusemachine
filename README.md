# Fusemachine Fellowship Learning Journal

A simple repository to track my learning journey and projects during the Fusemachine Fellowship.

## Structure

- **daily-learning/**: Daily notes and lessons learned
- **projects/**: Project work completed during the fellowship
- **resources/**: Useful resources, links, and references

## How to Use

1. Document daily learnings in the `daily-learning` folder using markdown files (e.g., `2025-04-29.md`)
2. Store project code and documentation in the `projects` folder
3. Save helpful resources in the `resources` folder

## Quick Start

```bash
# To create a new daily learning entry
touch daily-learning/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d").md
```

Happy learning!
